Game process:
	Deal
	Bid
	Play Trick (repeat for all tricks)
	Score


Create game (options: player limit)
start:
	@begun = true
	@deal
	set @expectedTurn
	callback

[clients examine @expectedTurn and first bidder bids]

makeMove:
	validate bid/move (validateMove)
	@moves.push(move)
	if move is last of the trick, call concludeTrick()
	set @expectedTurn
	callback

[this repeats until all players have played a card]

concludeTrick:
	find winning card of trick
	[next up would be scoring but this isn't implemented yet]
