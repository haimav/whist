Game process:
	Deal
	Bid
	Play Trick (repeat for all tricks)
	Score


Create game (options: player limit)
start:
	@begun = true
	@deal
	set @expectedTurn
	callback

[clients examine @expectedTurn and first bidder bids]

makeMove:
	validate bid/move (validateMove)
	@moves.push(move)
	if move is last of the trick, call concludeTrick()
	set @expectedTurn
	callback

[this repeats until all players have played a card]

concludeTrick:
	find winning card of trick
	if trick is last trick:
		calculateScore()
		increment round
	else
		reset @table
		reset


TODO: 	Have winner of previous round choose trumps
		Have dealer rotate

Client:
	move:
		{type, playerID, value}
		where value is 
			type == bid  	--> int
			type == card 	--> {suit, value, owner}
			type == trumps 	--> suit


Player rotation:
	Pick [0] for fist trick
	shift(winner)
